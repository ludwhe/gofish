.SH NAME
gmap2cache \- convert gophermap files to .cache files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gmap2cache
[\fI\-c config\fR] [\fI\-rv\fR] [\fIdirectory\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
gmap2cache converts Bucktooth gophermap files to .cache files for the
GoFish gopher server.
.PP
Because all files are specified relative to the gopher root directory,
it is very important that the root directory is set correctly. gmap2cache
reads the same configuration file used by GoFish.
.PP
The directory to process defaults to the root directory.  If you
explicitly set
.B directory,
it must be a subdirectory of the root directory.
.PP
.SH WARNING
gmap2cache will overwrite all existing .cache files.
